# Quiz
An interactive quiz page using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

The Quiz App with Timer consists of three sequential layers or boxes that are displayed one after another upon specific button clicks.
It begins with a "Start Quiz" button, triggering the appearance of an info box with a popup animation.
The info box contains quiz rules and options to "Exit" or "Continue."
Clicking "Exit" hides the info box, while clicking "Continue" reveals the Quiz Box.
The Quiz Box includes a header with a title on the left and a countdown timer on the right.
The timer counts down from 15 to 0 seconds, with a sliding timeline indicator.
User selection of an option between 15 to 0 seconds stops the timer and disables all available options.
Correct selections display in green with a tick icon, while incorrect selections turn red with a cross icon. The correct answer is automatically selected.
If no option is chosen before the timer reaches 0, it stops, and the correct answer is auto-selected.
A "Next" button facilitates navigation to the next question, with a total of five questions in the quiz.
Upon completion, a result box appears, displaying the user's score and providing options to "Replay Quiz" or "Quit Quiz."
Clicking "Replay Quiz" restarts the quiz from question 1 with a score of 0, while "Quit Quiz" reloads the window to start anew.
